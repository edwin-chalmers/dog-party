## About
In the Static Comp Challenge, my goal is to fine-tune my HTML and SCSS skills by replicating a provided design with the utmost precision. I'm given a strict four-hour limit to ensure that I focus intensely on matching every aspect of the original design, from layout and spacing to font, imagery, and color. TThis project is purely about static accuracy, without the need for responsiveness or JavaScript functionality. This challenge simulates a real-world scenario where adhering to a design team's specifications is crucial, emphasizing the importance of detail-oriented development in my coding journey.
